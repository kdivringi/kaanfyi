  <h1>Obligatory post about my blogging stack</h1>

  <p>
    Spoiler alert: It's <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>. Or
    <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>
    to be more precise. And nothing else...
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to use sapper as a slightly more jumped up version of <a
      href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a
    >. I don't forsee ever using the server bits of it and will be deploying it
    the JAMstack way on Netlify. I do want the <em>ability</em> to do component driven
    development and incorporate the interactive capabilities of a bonafide JS framework
    as necessary. But I want it to get out of the way.
  </p>

  <h2>The data plateau</h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/"
      >Eleventy data cascade</a
    > is one of those features that makes people go wow about the simplicity. It's
    a tremendous abstraction for a framework that otherwise does not do much of that
    for you. I'm opting out of it, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    The template for the Sapper startup had a blog section setup that lookedâ€¦
    unappealing to say the least. The html was manually embedded in JSON and the
    generic blog component had to prefix all of the styles with a global to get
    around the unused style elimination of Svelte. It seemed like the framework
    was fighting itself. I know that I could probably setup whatever markdown
    pipeline to improve this but figuring this out was such a bikeshedding black
    hole. Here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas that I had for my "blog
    infrastructure":
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte-kit</a>: Recently in beta but I
      tried it and changes did not refresh in my browser. Nope! Let's be boring
      for a bit.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, with some combination of
      Clojure/ClojureScript to interact with it ergonomically. Integrating a
      separate tech stack for a static site and learning a different way to
      model data in a language I'm a bit rusty in seemed like a bridge too far.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">DataScript </a> with some combination
      of mori-js bridge so I could maybe get Datomic-esque but still be in Javascript.
      Questioned the value of what I'd be learning, ie just an imitation of the real
      thing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Flat data files with <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/patches"
        >ImmerJS</a
      > patch stream to have an event source stream of changes. If I just use static
      files, don't I get this kinda for free from git anyways?
    </li>
    <li>
      Screwing off entirely and going back to Eleventy because Sapper layout
      inheritance seemed too simplistic. But I want to have the option to build
      beautiful interactive experiences with component driven workflows.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All of that was just procrastination from doing what's important: just
    getting out there and writing. So I'm going to just use files. Each blog
    post will be a Svelte component, no [slug].svelte routing indirection.
    Writing just becomes mostly creating a new file in a directory. The main
    challenge then becomes generating listing content from a directory of files.
    I can easily do this with Markdown frontmatter, right?
  </p>

  <h2>No markdown thanks</h2>
  <p>
    Actually markdown seemed to conflict with one of my stated goals of
    providing beautiful interactivity if I needed it. Going down this rabbit
    hole lead to investigation into what MDX equivalents would be in
    Svelte-land. Those are some technical decisions that I both don't want to
    blaze a trail in or put in front of myself and writing things that go out on
    the internet. Given that, what is it that markdown is giving you over HTML?
    I can use <a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> and be decently productive in
    writing prose. It may be less structure overall, and be difficult to standardize
    and update styling across the entire site but I'm ok with that. I think it will
    be fun to see how this site evolves as I improve, to be honest. I don't need
    to go for the professional look across historical blog posts. I may reconsider
    this, since it Emmet has been a bit annoying so far in VS Code (especially for
    links, sheesh) but that's how I'm moving forward for the time being.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do lose frontmatter by using Svelte components instead of markdown,
    however. My intention is to just have a data file extension of the same name
    or something similar. I can change 2 files at a time, especially if I help
    myself with some automation. Let me get to the point where I have enough
    posts such that updating a listing page manually becomes laborious. That
    will be a good problem to have.
  </p>

  <h2>CSS rough going</h2>

  The site will look kinda janky for a bit. While I'm a frontend developer, I'm
  more of a <a
    href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/"
    >the back of the frontend</a
  > developer at my job. I don't usually build from scratch without the assistance
  of frameworks or component libraries. So I'm forcing myself to learn. I hope to
  not use any external CSS, apart from some reset style help, perhaps. It feels like
  'getting my hands dirty' and using the platform on a more intimate level. I look
  forward to the fun experimentation I can unlock without needing to polyfill or
  consider compatibility. This will be a space for me to play and I look forward
  to it.
